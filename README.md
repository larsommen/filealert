# filealert

Requires PySimpleGUI (install: python -m pip install PySimpleGUI)

alert on different file properties (age, last modified etc.)

usage:

python main.py filename

Version 2:
usage:

python main2.py filename1 filename2  (last one optional)

at the moment path is not supported - only works in folder with file
and windows only

The idea is that you create a bat to run this and activate it in Task Scheduler (windows admin tool)
